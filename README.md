# php-club-events
A small web app to display filterable sailing events from a CSV file and provide an API to access the data. See it live here:

This is early days and plan is to have a library which could be used in a WordPress module. Currently, an early version is running inside a Drupal module here:

[http://www.swanagesailingclub.org.uk/sailing/sailing-programme](http://www.swanagesailingclub.org.uk/sailing/sailing-programme)

and this whole site is being moved to WordPress. Using this it'd be easy to have a WordPress/Drupal panel showing upcoming events too, or export the data to Google calendar format.
